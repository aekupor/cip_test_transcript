WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.550
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Let's do that

2
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.080
Dora Demszky: by, too. We? And then

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.520
No, it's gonna. I think it's

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.050
Dora Demszky: transcribing.

5
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.180
Dora Demszky: Yeah, I think it is.

6
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.090
Dora Demszky: It's transcribing stuff. So yeah, i'll send you what I have after this.

7
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.020
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Okay, great. Can you send a few things in the chat, too?

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.490
Dora Demszky: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:50.040
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Okay, Great. Yeah, that would be helpful. Let's see. I think so. Yeah, those are the big last to do on my end.

10
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.200
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Okay? And then the big question I have is

11
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.510
Ashlee Kupor (SL): where these are going to live the like how we're gonna pull the transcripts in.

12
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.850
Ashlee Kupor (SL): I looked into just doing as a Google drive link, and

13
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:19.190
Dora Demszky: it's a lot of work to get it up and running, if that's not going to be the way we actually are storing them in the end. So I sent a message to Chris, and I don't think he ever responded.

14
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.100
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah.

15
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.470
Ashlee Kupor (SL): if we can, we get an answer on where they're going to be stored? Because then I I don't want to like double.

16
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.990
Do a lot of work

17
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.110
Ashlee Kupor (SL): to like.

18
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.750
Dora Demszky: just for like one test, if that makes sense.

19
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.380
Dora Demszky: Yes, yes, for sure.

20
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:48.830
Dora Demszky: I think he is just gonna provide us with some links.

21
00:01:49.580 --> 00:02:01.980
Dora Demszky: and I think it's probably he said something like Google Cloud. But let me let me follow up. I know that. Probably it's crazy for him. So I just I just

22
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.620
Dora Demszky: p him. I think tomorrow or something, or maybe yeah, that's

23
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.280
Ashlee Kupor (SL): okay.

24
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.810
Dora Demszky: Okay, yeah, hope I just message him. Hopefully, i'll get back.

25
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:28.760
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Okay, Great. Because yeah, I think that's a big question. So yeah, once we have that, then we just need to add it into the like actual flow. So like

26
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.650
Ashlee Kupor (SL): I I don't know when exactly we want to run this.

27
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.280
But

28
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:45.850
Ashlee Kupor (SL): yeah, we're basically need to. Yeah, we can just call our our endpoint with the transcript. It's already working.

29
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.400
Ashlee Kupor (SL): No, the endpoints not working yet, because it it will work. Once we add in the file reading stuff.

30
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.750
Dora Demszky: Okay, Awesome. So

31
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.510
Dora Demszky: is it.

32
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:22.220
Dora Demszky: Is it possible, like, is there some easy way to just create a link for a file like I'm. I'm not sure. Like. Maybe Google drives is a lot of work, because you probably have to do authentication and that kind of stuff. And when they send me like public link we could just

33
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.920
Dora Demszky: create for a file.

34
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.780
Dora Demszky: I I've no idea. But just really for testing purposes.

35
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.400
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah. So some sort of

36
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.250
Ashlee Kupor (SL): well. So you said you think it's gonna be on Google Cloud.

37
00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:52.730
Dora Demszky: I think that's what he said. I I think that's what Chris to say. Ideally like it should be just a link, and you can, I mean, I think, for now we should just do something where you don't need authentication. It's just a link.

38
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.610
Dora Demszky: You download it like, and it works so I

39
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.840
Dora Demszky: I could host it on my

40
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.010
Dora Demszky: well, no, actually my website.

41
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.120
Dora Demszky: I don't.

42
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.610
Dora Demszky: or like a github like. Could it be a hard link for just for now.

43
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.290
Dora Demszky: like a public github thing

44
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.030
Dora Demszky: like you. Yeah. So let's see. I'm just

45
00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.270
Ashlee Kupor (SL): seeing here let me share my screen.

46
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.610
Ashlee Kupor (SL): We could try to do something like this reading from cloud storage. So

47
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:44.700
Ashlee Kupor (SL): I assume, yeah, we are going to need some sort of Api key right to get the bucket. Not sure what. And then

48
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.670
Dora Demszky: Yeah. Okay.

49
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.950
Dora Demszky: here. Okay. So I think I think that Leslie said that up before we sure you need it.

50
00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:02.580
Dora Demszky: But the way that you could actually do like, you know, you just you can use our own github, or something like that. You just

51
00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.790
Dora Demszky: raw like, you know you have a text, and then you just

52
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.780
Dora Demszky: upload like a raw file like the Vtt. Transcript

53
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.750
Dora Demszky: to let's say our github, or something like that, and then. and then just experiment with that.

54
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.870
Dora Demszky: For now, with that like, you know.

55
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:30.030
Ashlee Kupor (SL): I think that I I thought you just said you didn't want the Vt. That that that that transcript to be

56
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:31.410
Ashlee Kupor (SL): public

57
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.960
Dora Demszky: we could use whenever we now get from this conversation?

58
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:45.940
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Oh, sure, that's a great idea. Also like you could put it behind like on our github, which I think is private. But I don't

59
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.460
Dora Demszky: no if it's going to create other issues of like

60
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.830
Dora Demszky: in the endpoint needing to authenticate anything.

61
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.870
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah, that's a good idea. Let's just use this as our transcript.

62
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:10.020
Dora Demszky: Yeah, I think, for now we just want so make sure everything works, and then we can figure out like the authentication stuff.

63
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.480
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Cool? Okay.

64
00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.280
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Okay.

65
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.480
Ashlee Kupor (SL): awesome. Yeah, If you can send me this transcript, then once you get it. That would be great.

66
00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.740
Dora Demszky: Yeah, I will for sure. And

67
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.440
Dora Demszky: I have. Yeah, do you have any other questions or to do?

68
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.790
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Let me see. So yeah, got to filter out this section leaders or you add in the chat.

69
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.890
I need to fix the Json.

70
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:52.480
Ashlee Kupor (SL): And then, yeah, the next big one is yeah, adding in the files.

71
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:57.250
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah, I think that's that's all my big questions.

72
00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:04.390
Dora Demszky: I think. Yeah, that sounds funny, and it's great. So I think for for my perspective. It's just.

73
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:08.130
Dora Demszky: It would be nice if we could

74
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:16.270
Dora Demszky: somehow. Do you identify the transcript? Just? I mean, I think

75
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.680
Dora Demszky: there are pros and cons so

76
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.330
Dora Demszky: meaning that like

77
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:39.370
Dora Demszky: you would literally just like replace the section leader. Name with with you something like that, you section leader or whatever, because they they're gonna get their own. So it could be just you. And then students would be just. Every individual name would be like

78
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:46.280
Dora Demszky: to unique, like student, one student, 2, or you could even just do like their first.

79
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.740
Dora Demszky: and like something like that. I think

80
00:08:51.830 --> 00:09:05.160
Dora Demszky: the thing about it is that it's gonna be private to them. So it. I I think one question that I have is whether it's more confusing to them if they can see their students names.

81
00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:09.500
Dora Demszky: because that might be the conversation better.

82
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:21.870
Dora Demszky: But okay, so this is like, I think I would say, like not high priority. But I just wanted to sort of make sure to somewhere on the list, because I do think, when we do our analyses

83
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:28.170
Dora Demszky: in turn, like ideally, the transcripts that are not the identified should not live anywhere

84
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:46.750
Dora Demszky: like ideally at some point, even if it's just for our own internal purposes, we should de identify them. and it's fine for them to see their own transcript, but probably not for anyone else to really see their transcript like without the identification. So

85
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:55.420
Ashlee Kupor (SL): yeah, in terms of the identifying, just thinking about how the code structured. It would be really easy.

86
00:09:55.610 --> 00:10:04.430
Ashlee Kupor (SL): just like when we read in the Transcript. Obviously, it would say, like, actually, Dora, I could just say, every time you see, actually replace the student

87
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:07.310
or like student one whatever.

88
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.490
Dora Demszky: But

89
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:13.080
Ashlee Kupor (SL): yeah, I agree. Probably not.

90
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:20.150
Oh, well, now, i'm thinking. I believe, that how it is now, when I return it

91
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.090
Ashlee Kupor (SL): it will say, student, Wait no Won't.

92
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.440
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah, no, it won't. Say, student, it will say the student name.

93
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.250
but that we could change that if needed.

94
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:43.730
Dora Demszky: Yeah. So I I think it's help Also, for example, like in connecting right a lot of times connecting you're like, oh.

95
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.150
actually.

96
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.890
Ashlee Kupor (SL): said this, Dora. What do you think? Right? So it's using student names already.

97
00:10:50.500 --> 00:11:02.840
Dora Demszky: This names are actually okay. I'm: more concerned about full names in the zoom username. I'm: most concerned about just speaker names, you know. And it's

98
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.450
Dora Demszky: Yeah, I think first names are fine. You can't really trace that back.

99
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.280
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah.

100
00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:16.920
Dora Demszky: So maybe I guess this is because what you're doing, I guess, is you are going to pipe from a

101
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.760
Dora Demszky: ideally like private storage, and then

102
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:22.700
Dora Demszky: I think

103
00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:36.920
Dora Demszky: I think I do think I actually it would be kind of nice for you to not just typing back. but save at least the de identified transcript locally, because so many things can break

104
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:55.820
Dora Demszky: to have, like a copy of the transcription of the our goals and data, or whatever somewhere that's not just the database, but that should be de identified like anything. I guess that is not doesn't live on the code in place. Private thing

105
00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:02.700
Dora Demszky: should be de-identified maybe that's a better way to frame that Well.

106
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.090
Ashlee Kupor (SL): so you're you're in to save it all

107
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:13.830
Ashlee Kupor (SL): sorry. Oh, like Why, in case something goes wrong? Because our are we still gonna have the transcript link

108
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.440
Ashlee Kupor (SL): in the database.

109
00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:23.610
Dora Demszky: Yes, yes, we will. I guess

110
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.990
Ashlee Kupor (SL): it's like, I guess, here at. If something went wrong we could just like, run it back through the model again.

111
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:40.830
Dora Demszky: Yeah, that is true. Okay, maybe it's it's just something we can do at the end or something like that. But I guess I just wanna make sure. There.

112
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:49.070
Dora Demszky: we some. We we don't lose them, sure. Yeah, maybe we can think, because also, if we're sending it into this

113
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:57.210
Ashlee Kupor (SL): when you say, save locally right. This endpoints running on. hugging me. So we definitely don't want to save it.

114
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:03.440
Ashlee Kupor (SL): They are not there. No, no, no, no, no, no, No, no, no, not there, I mean

115
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:20.590
Dora Demszky: so I don't know exactly like. Are you planning to completely to me the workflow? Meaning I did. That would be ideal, I guess. But if it's not possible like, yeah, I guess is, it is a current plan to just pipe everything automatically

116
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.230
Dora Demszky: and then back into the front end like to, or the database.

117
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:41.610
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah, we haven't talked about that flow yet. But I I think there's a couple of ways we'd one is we could basically I don't. I mean, I also, like I don't know, Reacts depicts the expert in that. But, like

118
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.780
Ashlee Kupor (SL): i'm thinking if we can put in like some

119
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.460
watcher for the database, so like

120
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:59.350
Ashlee Kupor (SL): as soon as a new transcript is added for section later. just run that through the model. Put the data back in, so that then, whenever they click on their feedback page. it's ready to go.

121
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:10.570
Dora Demszky: Yes, yes, it's that would be ideal, but it's not really a reacting. It's a back end thing, which I think is in python. So which is possible.

122
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.860
Dora Demszky: you know you could. I don't actually know how their back end works, but that's how I set it up

123
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:30.850
Dora Demszky: Last time is that there's this thing called the Celery Task. Every like 15 min or so you can check for any new entries in the database, and then it runs. The process runs that data through a process.

124
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:44.860
Dora Demszky: I I guess we just all of the things that are going on. I feel like I wouldn't count on it. It would be really nice. Yeah, yeah, that's about

125
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.520
Dora Demszky: what I did.

126
00:14:51.100 --> 00:15:03.840
Dora Demszky: So I did actually like ended up just downloading all the transcripts locally from code in place last time ha processing it through my thing

127
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.330
Dora Demszky: and then putting it back in.

128
00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:11.830
Dora Demszky: I think that's what ended up happening. So

129
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.380
Dora Demszky: I think we just have to

130
00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:28.730
Ashlee Kupor (SL): by by by downloading or like, yeah, if that's possible. I'm having to do like we can at least plan on it, just because there's so many moving parts now we can at least plan on that for the first week, and then try to get something.

131
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.800
Dora Demszky: Yes, it's automated.

132
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:40.250
Ashlee Kupor (SL): I don't know. Maybe maybe if you want to. especially since you've done that like I just don't know, like I don't even have the

133
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:45.120
Ashlee Kupor (SL): the code base set up yet right? Because I've just been working on the model. So like.

134
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:49.450
Ashlee Kupor (SL): if you want to take the lead on that, or deepak, or something, I think would be helpful. Just so.

135
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:55.620
Ashlee Kupor (SL): I think there's just like a lot of overhead to get. The thing is that I don't.

136
00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.320
Dora Demszky: So the way that I did it last time was basically I had my own entire app

137
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.540
Dora Demszky: that was running, and

138
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:18.160
Dora Demszky: that was kind of my own that I had my own back end, which is separate. I did not touch their back end. It was not an setup, I think, because I mean it was still manual work. I just did that once a week. I downloaded the data from code in place

139
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.830
Dora Demszky: and then fed it through my app

140
00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:27.590
Dora Demszky: and then could plug back the so I think that.

141
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Dora Demszky: And again.

142
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:44.760
Dora Demszky: because that was like a totally separate back end like I, that's for control over it. And I I think here it would has to be someone like I probably not you or not me or

143
00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.350
Dora Demszky: like, just

144
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.130
Dora Demszky: because it's kind of a sensitive

145
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:57.040
Dora Demszky: thing, I think to like. Add that process in. That's kind of doing stuff on the back end. So

146
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:04.010
Dora Demszky: okay, so I guess what? What? I'm just trying to say that I think it might actually not be that much work

147
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:16.300
Dora Demszky: every day run like you have. You have a script that basically just runs through the storage checks for any new files.

148
00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.490
Dora Demszky: Download it

149
00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:25.859
Dora Demszky: locally. We're not downloaded. You might not even need to download it. You just pipe it through directly

150
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:47.520
Dora Demszky: and then save the results and upload to the database. So this could just be. I guess it 2 step. You probably have to wait until the process. The the Api gives you the results back, especially if it's like

151
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.750
Dora Demszky: 200 transcript. It's not gonna be an instant.

152
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.910
Dora Demszky: but it's Really, I don't think it's that that

153
00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:05.330
Dora Demszky: that terrible of a setup, because we to batch things, because if you want to show the average, it would have to be.

154
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:17.660
Dora Demszky: and taxes. so it every like. I don't know every night whenever I like you, just it should be all automated ideally. So it really wouldn't take a lot of your time, I think.

155
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.750
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Okay, yeah.

156
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:33.090
Dora Demszky: I guess just what I was I was saying. There is that if you do download. maybe it is safest to in that like process.

157
00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:45.380
Dora Demszky: when, like basically on. And the Api just replace names. If there's at any point like, you know, the data is like locally saved, and all that. Or you could just delete it afterwards. But I guess

158
00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:50.470
Dora Demszky: if we want to de identify eventually, anyways, then it might be

159
00:18:53.040 --> 00:19:00.390
Dora Demszky: Yeah, I don't know. What do you think you think about the way I see it in my head?

160
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.340
Ashlee Kupor (SL): I mean, yeah, I don't know.

161
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:12.750
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah, how to do the script exactly, but that it's basically, just gonna get a whole bunch of links right? That links to a transcript that lives somewhere.

162
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:22.530
Ashlee Kupor (SL): And then right I have that api endpoint. So i'm just calling the endpoint with the link with eliciting or whatever. And then that's returning.

163
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:31.130
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Jason, and then that Jason's just getting pushed directly to the database like I don't see really any part of the process where it

164
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:40.480
Ashlee Kupor (SL): would be saved locally, like we just send a link into this Api endpoint, and then we get Json back. and that might be de identified. But like I'm not.

165
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:46.490
Ashlee Kupor (SL): That's getting pushed saved right to the database, and then we move to the next to the database.

166
00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.170
Dora Demszky: How do you save it to the database?

167
00:19:50.420 --> 00:20:01.540
Ashlee Kupor (SL): So that's all the Json I mean. None of that is written yet, but the Json that it returns would just get saved into. I talked with Deepak about the different fields like

168
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:10.320
Dora Demszky: there's like 4 things we need to. but I guess that script has to run on the code in place back end. Yeah.

169
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:20.800
Dora Demszky: So I think that's a key piece where we can. I think 100% rely on that. We might have to. You might have to run a script

170
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:27.790
Dora Demszky: that's not in the back their back end, you know. Also, I don't think they're because

171
00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:31.070
Ashlee Kupor (SL): neither do you back, or I know what like.

172
00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:41.920
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Apparently they have no back end. They are serverless, Matt said. So they don't have any. Yeah, I I we do what he said. We were talking to him yesterday

173
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:58.390
Ashlee Kupor (SL): like, yeah, we said, we want to save data from the back end to the firestore database. How do we do this inside? Blah blah cip is completely serverless to do anything in the back end you would have to spin up your own server.

174
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.260
Ashlee Kupor (SL): So yeah, I guess our script

175
00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.060
Ashlee Kupor (SL): would need to live somewhere on our own.

176
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:07.470
Dora Demszky: Yeah, okay.

177
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.240
Dora Demszky: Got it so

178
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:20.700
Dora Demszky: which we could do. I mean, that's what I did last time

179
00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.070
Dora Demszky: it

180
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:33.880
Dora Demszky: feels like an overkill. I'm. Confused that they don't have a back end. They must have something that's confusing. So how do they?

181
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:42.040
Dora Demszky: What does it mean that it's like. But how are they doing all these other things like.

182
00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.200
Dora Demszky: I don't know. I'm: i'm a little confused by that.

183
00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.650
Dora Demszky: But yeah, yeah, same.

184
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:53.640
Dora Demszky: Okay, so.

185
00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:01.350
Dora Demszky: But in any case, I think we are talking about just some that I basically the exact same thing. I think the only question is

186
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:15.220
Dora Demszky: whether you're you're gonna press that button on your own on your own computer. Like to run the script that script or is like, is it happening on the back end of automatically. And I think.

187
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:20.380
Dora Demszky: honestly, I don't think it makes. I'm happy to yeah press button.

188
00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.980
Dora Demszky: Yeah, it's just it. Just

189
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:43.920
Ashlee Kupor (SL): so Deepak has insight into how data could be saved. That's something I have no idea. For example. Yeah, we do know how to save data. There's like a he. Yeah, we were talking about by us. There's like an update call to the back end or not to the back end to the database.

190
00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.590
Dora Demszky: Got it.

191
00:22:45.720 --> 00:23:03.700
Dora Demszky: Okay, but the thing is so okay. So, for example, I do think that there has to be a back end, because if Chris is saving the zoom recordings automatically, and I think he was sharing a python script, for that happens somewhere on the back end, and I imagine he's not gonna do that manually.

192
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.570
Dora Demszky: So they have. They are running process that just gonna do that automatically for him.

193
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:16.170
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah, that maybe we could just stick our code in there. That would be like the first place for it to live right

194
00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:22.040
Dora Demszky: sure. Could you maybe ask Chris about that? Yes, yes, so let me ask him.

195
00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:33.960
Dora Demszky: I was gonna actually schedule a time for us 3 to meet. I actually my deep had to

196
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:39.480
Dora Demszky: next early next week to just go through. I don't know all these

197
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.880
Dora Demszky: last minute. Okay. But I guess the the thing is.

198
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:55.430
Dora Demszky: Yeah, this all sounds good. So then the other. The last thing I wanted to talk about was

199
00:23:55.930 --> 00:24:01.720
Dora Demszky: which I think all the things that you're doing now are like the highest priority. But then there's

200
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:05.240
Dora Demszky: the training team.

201
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.180
Dora Demszky: I don't know if you saw that.

202
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.840
Dora Demszky: Okay. So here.

203
00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:29.810
Dora Demszky: Do you see my screen?

204
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.660
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah.

205
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.760
Dora Demszky: Okay, Great.

206
00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.680
Dora Demszky: So

207
00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:39.270
Dora Demszky: So basically they just

208
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:51.140
Dora Demszky: had some. I suggestions for updating the feedback page like the part where you start. and then I guess these are things for deep fuck, I guess. But

209
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:09.680
Dora Demszky: okay, i'm just reading it.

210
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:14.500
Dora Demszky: So you don't want to change anything.

211
00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:17.520
Dora Demszky: Okay? Yeah, it doesn't sound like it.

212
00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:27.260
Dora Demszky: Yeah, I don't love this phrasing, though curiosity was exhibited like, what do we mean by that?

213
00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:34.070
Ashlee Kupor (SL): I isn't that in the the reflection.

214
00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:35.970
Dora Demszky: It is. But

215
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:48.850
Dora Demszky: but I just don't love that wording because it's come. I I feel like, do we mean like I think it's a place harder kind of that debug put in there. I think we can. We couldn't make that. But anyways.

216
00:25:48.960 --> 00:26:00.620
Dora Demszky: Okay, that reminds me, I should just send this page to heather for comments, and maybe we could come out with a slightly better phrasing. But it sounds like that Training team is fine with it.

217
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.180
Dora Demszky: Yeah.

218
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:14.870
Dora Demszky: And was there anything else about the page that that we would? We wanted to change? Okay, let me ask you, like actually to send us the latest

219
00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:24.690
Dora Demszky: person. So yeah, that's I think. Yeah. Working on the script. It sounds great. I will send you the Chat transcript and the actual transcript from this. So you can like.

220
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.850
Dora Demszky: create that

221
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:32.570
Dora Demszky: thing, and then let's wait to hear back from Chris about

222
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.780
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah, I guess where the files will live and then how to?

223
00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:46.400
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah. He has a script, if we can just add in our own thing there, and if you have the code that you did from last year, that would be helpful, too.

224
00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:53.500
Dora Demszky: I probably won't be able to get to that scripting for

225
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:57.590
Dora Demszky: my script. Oh, yeah, right. It runs on your own.

226
00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:04.720
Dora Demszky: Yes, and it it's not. It was not using having face at all.

227
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:07.170
Dora Demszky: It pretty much.

228
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:12.830
Dora Demszky: Yeah, so I and i'm not even sure if we are plugging it in. I'm not even sure if we need this

229
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:22.940
Dora Demszky: tasks that repeatedly checks, we could just do it at the with the same go as when the transcript is being saved. The same time you send it

230
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:24.530
Dora Demszky: so. I think that would be great.

231
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:38.150
Dora Demszky: simple, and then relatedly One thing that you could try out, though, if if you send it to file. Is it going? Coming back instantaneously, or do you have to like wait for it?

232
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:42.270
Dora Demszky: I guess this is like you send you. Send this. You send the transcript.

233
00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.640
Dora Demszky: does it?

234
00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:59.610
Dora Demszky: Yeah, okay, I I realize my question Doesn't: quite make sense. I know that, for example, for for some of the transcription services. The way that they work is, You send the post request, and then

235
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.930
Dora Demszky: your

236
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.760
Dora Demszky: you're done, and then it it kind of later

237
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:17.030
Dora Demszky: you can query, for it's results again. But I know that the so inference api doesn't work that way. But you like, just get calling a function. You get a results right away.

238
00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:25.620
Dora Demszky: But yeah, just confirm, like, yeah, you could try out like how long it takes, because there might be latency might create some issues like, if it's

239
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.970
Dora Demszky: if it's.

240
00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.860
Dora Demszky: I do know that. like

241
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:51.530
Dora Demszky: we were using the Api, and when the transcript was really long, like, I think it's only an issue when there are like thousands of us. but now we've we've been recording for a while. So i'm hoping this transcript will be long. You could like double the size you could duplicate it so that you can just see if it fails or has any issues

242
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.360
Dora Demszky: when it's like a long, long transcript.

243
00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.690
Dora Demszky: Okay, yeah.

244
00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:58.600
Dora Demszky: Sorry.

245
00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.090
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah. I mean, I i'm just thinking how.

246
00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.850
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah, Never mind. Oh, yeah, I I see what you're saying.

247
00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:12.640
Dora Demszky: Yeah. And then maybe just one small thing, which is.

248
00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:19.410
Dora Demszky: do you? If you can just add a flag or like a function that

249
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:24.820
Dora Demszky: anonymizes things, and if you could just turn it on if you want it, you know, if

250
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.200
Dora Demszky: if it it we later on, we could just decide to anonymize or not

251
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:37.450
Dora Demszky: in the process, you know, on the or in your handler, and it could just be an argument which is like, anonymize

252
00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.610
Dora Demszky: or not.

253
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.530
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Okay, yeah. I I mean.

254
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:53.490
Ashlee Kupor (SL): I just this is so much to do, and I I have a lot other going on, too. So yeah, I I will do my best. But I think

255
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.480
Ashlee Kupor (SL): probably that, like the highest priorities, I will get the like

256
00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:07.710
Ashlee Kupor (SL): models up and going, and like making sure that yeah, it works with depth. I don't know if you can take on or like as much as you can help with the script

257
00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:10.460
Ashlee Kupor (SL): would be helpful

258
00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:16.130
Ashlee Kupor (SL): just because I know there's there's a ton ton to do, especially when it's done before Monday.

259
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:32.410
Dora Demszky: Thank you so much for for doing all this. It's it's been like awesome, too, that you like. You just like You're so independently like, did everything. And like, yeah, thank you. Very little like. And holding, which is that I was just like amazing.

260
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:39.470
Ashlee Kupor (SL): And I really appreciate that. Yes. So I yeah, I think, yeah, I just don't want to prom like my my grandparents are visiting this weekend, so I don't want to like

261
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:58.650
Dora Demszky: promise too much, and under deliver. So yeah, like as much as yeah. So either me or Depa can help. I do have like a a paper that i'm doing. I know it's it's, but I think that I I agree that to chat transcript and just making sure it works with the file.

262
00:30:58.650 --> 00:30:59.600
Dora Demszky: It's all

263
00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:18.620
Dora Demszky: Yeah, I think that those should be like re relatively straightforward, and anything else could wait. And I will figure out what was the process. And then don't you, don't worry about that. Now let's definitely chat about that on Monday or whenever we yeah work with yeah, because it I don't think it makes sense to start

264
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.750
Ashlee Kupor (SL): it. Now, if we're just gonna have to change it later.

265
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:25.360
Ashlee Kupor (SL): But yeah, no, that makes sense. I will.

266
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:29.400
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah. Work on everything except pick up the script for now.

267
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:34.100
Dora Demszky: Yes, and the d identification to. I can just do that if this helpful, I think.

268
00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:39.350
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah, I think it should. That that should be really easy.

269
00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.550
Dora Demszky: Just

270
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:53.920
Ashlee Kupor (SL): yeah, when we're saving the names instead of saving it as the person we can just replace it with a the. But yeah, I I know I know how we could do that in code pretty easily.

271
00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.250
Dora Demszky: Okay, Great. Okay. So it's really.

272
00:31:56.270 --> 00:32:06.480
Dora Demszky: hopefully, hopefully, it's the biggest lift, I think, is just merging the chat. I think that because and and there, by the way.

273
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.640
Dora Demszky: I think that Candace has written a script for that already, and I

274
00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:19.910
Dora Demszky: now maybe she will send you something. Maybe she put it already on on the github of

275
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:25.700
Dora Demszky: hers. I'm. Not sure. Probably not. But you could just ask

276
00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:28.850
Dora Demszky: if she has a script for merging.

277
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.360
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah, let's see, she sent me a while ago this sample whisper

278
00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.770
Ashlee Kupor (SL): transcript.

279
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.650
Ashlee Kupor (SL): I don't know if this has anything with chat.

280
00:32:45.390 --> 00:33:01.430
Dora Demszky: Oh, and I remember so she actually probably Doesn't: because I think she wasn't working with Vtt: transcripts. Oh, yeah, this is temporary version that excludes chat transcripts.

281
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:15.240
Ashlee Kupor (SL): Yeah, no. It looks like the data she's reading in already has a value. If it's chat or not.

282
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:42.970
Dora Demszky: Okay, great. I have to run to another meeting. Now. Yeah, I keep you updated on slack, and i'm sure it will be great, and it will be fine, and I feel like the heavy. The hardest part is already done, so that's great. The models are there? And yeah.

283
00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:44.190
Dora Demszky: so

284
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.160
Dora Demszky: awesome. All right, Talk to you soon.
